# Custom Range
Create a class called custom_range that receives a start (int) and an end (int) upon initialization. Implement the __iter__ and __next__ methods, so the iterator returns the numbers from the start to the end (inclusive).

# Reverse Iter
Create a class called reverse_iter which should receive an iterable upon initialization. Implement the __iter__ and __next__ methods, so the iterator returns the items of the iterable in reversed order.

# Vowels
Create a class called vowels, which should receive a string. Implement the __iter__ and __next__ methods, so the iterator returns only the vowels from the string.

# Squares
Create a generator function called squares that should receive a number n. It should generate the squares of all numbers from 1 to n (inclusive).

# Generator Range
Create a generator function called genrange that receives a start (int) and an end (int) upon initialization. It should generate all the numbers from the start to the end (inclusive).

# Reverse string
Create a generator function called reverse_text that receives a string and yields all string characters on one line in reversed order.
